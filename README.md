# Conferences That Pay Speakers

This list is a guide to technical and software conferences and what they pay or reimburse speakers for. This guide is
primarily aimed at traditional talks or workshop presenters (not keynotes but maybe in a future version). The goal is 
to bring awareness to what a speaker could expect to get out of an event, but also to compare events and how difficult 
it might be to get more underrepresented/underestimated speakers at an event.

The below conferences should compare:

* Event tickets and if they cover only the speaking day, the main event, or the full event
* Workshops (if applicable), and if it pays it if you speak, for one workshop, or the full event
* Lodging and if they cover only the night before/after, the main event, or the full event
* Travel and if they arrange a flight and taxi, reimburse your flight/taxi, or reimburse gas for driving
* Honorariums and if they only do it if you're in the US, only for the country the event is at, or for any origin country of the speaker

For virtual-only events, put N/A if it doesn't matter (ex: no lodging for a virtual call).

For in-person events turned virtual, please try to fill in as many in-person details as possible.

Please feel free to contribute to this list by adding additional conferences, adding missing information, or updating incorrect information.
